# React Server Components in Next.js

React Server Components + Next.js running in a lambda.

## How does it work?

We bundled the application APIs:
- `GET /index?id=0` (get all notes)
- `POST /index?id=0` (create new note)
- `GET,PUT,DELETE /index?id=<note_id>` (action for a specific note)

as well as React Server Components _render logic_ inside /api/index.js:
- `GET /index` (render application and return the serialized components)

Note that some of the application APIs (POST,PUT,DELETE) will render and return the serialized components as well. The render is handled by libs/send-res.src.js.

libs/send-res.src.js accepts the props (from req.query) that needs to be rendered by components/App.server.js (the component tree entry). It then renders the tree and stream it to `res` using:

```js
pipeToNodeWritable(React.createElement(ReactApp, props), res, moduleMap)
```

`moduleMap` is generated by application-wide Webpack (in our case, Next.js). It traversals both .server.js and .client.js and generates the full module map from `react-server-dom-webpack/plugin` Webpack plugin (see next.config.js). We then use a custom plugin to copy it to /public, so we can
fetch it from the lambda (since lambda's and Next.js' build processes are separated).

Also `ReactApp` is a special build of components/App.server.js, which stripes all the client components (into some special module) because they're not accessible from the server. We bundled it together with libs/send-res.src.js via another Webpack loader into libs/send-res.server.js. The Webpack plugin is under scripts/.

Finally, everything related to OAuth is inside /api/auth.js. It's basically a cookie-based session.

## Development
### Prepare

You need these environment variables to run this app (you can create a `.env` file):

```
REDIS_URL='rediss://:<password>@<url>:<port>' // or `redis://` if no TLS
ENDPOINT='http://localhost:3000'              // need to be absolute url to run in prod/local
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT='http://localhost:3000'  // same as above
SESSION_KEY='<random key for cookie-based session>'
OAUTH_CLIENT_KEY='github oauth app id'
OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET='github oauth app secret'
```

## Development

1. `yarn install` (this will trigger the postinstall command)
2. `vercel dev`
